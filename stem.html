        <h1>What is STEM Strand?</h1>
        <br>
    <p>The STEM strand in SHS is an inquiry and research-based program. It exposes students to more complex mathematics and science concepts and aims to serve as a foundation for their future college degrees. <br>

        Through various projects and research entailed, students develop problem-solving skills where they can apply scientific, technological, mathematical, and engineering concepts.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <h1>Advantages of the STEM Strand</h1>
        <p>The STEM strand gives senior high school students exposure to the intertwining disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) to see how they work in real life. The STEM strand:<br><br><br>

            •   Builds resilience in a safe environment by allowing students to experiment and to naturally experience failures as part of the learning process
            <br>
            •   Encourages teamwork so students can find solutions to problems, record data, write reports, give presentations, and prepare them for STEM strand    jobs
            <br>
            •   Teaches kids about the power and importance of technology, especially in today’s digital age
            <br>
            •   Fosters a habit of adaption when things don’t go as planned.</p> 
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            <h1>Possible College Courses Under the STEM Strand</h1>
            <p>Senior High School Students that pursue the STEM strand are more inclined towards complex scientific advancements and the future of modern technology.
                <br><br>

                Many of our STEM students go on to apply for undergraduate programs and explore their preferred specialized fields. Through the courses under the STEM strands, these students continue to grow into the country’s future scientists, engineers, programmers, and trailblazers within their niche.
