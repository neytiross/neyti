        <h1>What is ICT Strand?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Information Communication and Technology or ICT Strand is one of the strands offered under Technical-Vocational Livelihood (TVL)   
        Track of K-12 curriculum. ICT strand subjects seek to teach students concepts and skills in information technology.
        ICT in Senior High School equips students with the skills and knowledge they need to qualify for TESDA-backed 
        certifications such as the Certificate of Competency (COC) and National Certifications (NC).
        These ICT strand courses ensure that TVL track graduates of the ICT strand in SHS can apply for IT jobs straight out of high school.</p>
