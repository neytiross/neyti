        <h1>What is GAS Strand?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Senior High School(SHS)aims to prepare students with the skills and competencies they need for their desired college courses. This is why many SHS students choose to take up strands that have specialized subjects. However, there will always be students who are still undecided about what they will be taking up at the tertiary level and what career they want to pursue. That’s why the GAS strand in SHS in the Philippines was designed. <br>

 

            The GAS strand is created to cater to students who prefer a broader range of studies rather than specific fields. It offers SHS students the flexibility to choose electives from various strands, which helps in choosing a university degree. This article provides an overview of this strand including some courses that they can take for successful career paths in the future.</p>
            <br>
        <h1>Advantages of Taking GAS Strand</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The GAS program exposes senior high school students to a range of subjects, providing them the opportunity to discover which subject they are best suited for. Even with its exploratory approach, there are many advantages of taking the GAS strand in SHS in the Philippines. <br><br>

 

            Great selection of subjects
            Students in the GAS strand can expect to take on an excellent selection of subjects. These include general curriculum subjects like: <br><br>
            
            • General mathematics <br>
            • Statistics and probability <br> 
            • Philosophy <br>
            • Humanities <br>
            • Organization and management <br>
            • Life science <br>
            • Social science <br>
            •Applied economics and organization <br>
            • Oral communication <br>
            • Risk reduction and disaster preparedness <br> <br>
            After completing the subjects in the GAS strand, students can expect to feel prepared to take on almost any course in university since these subjects provide them with a solid foundation. Students who take the GAS strand will also feel more flexible when picking their specialization later. <br>  <br>
            
             
            
            A balanced mix of other strands
            Some may be wary that the GAS strand seems too broad. However, what many may not understand is that it is a mix of HUMMs, STEM, and ABM. When students take up this strand, they can expect to take these subjects simultaneously. <br><br>
            
            There is a wide range of subjects tackled here, from Applied Economics to Creative Writing to Philippine Politics. These can be ideal for those who are leaning towards the liberal arts especially if you’re interested in communication arts, legal management, or even journalism. You are provided with a rich educational background that you can carry over to your tertiary education. <br><br>
            
            It can be the same for those who want to pursue education. Taking this wide array of subjects can give you a solid foundation and idea of what you can specialize in for your education degree.</p>
